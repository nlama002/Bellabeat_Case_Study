# Bellabeat_Case_Study

1. Ask
1.1  Key Stakeholders
   1. Urska Srsen: Cofounder and Chief Creative Officer at Bellabeat.
   2. Sando Mur: Cofounder and key member of the Bellabeat executive team.
   3. Marketing analytics team at Bellabeat: A team of data analysts responsible for marketing
      bellaport product.
   4. Customers: People who purchases bellabeat product or use their service.


1.2 Business Task:
  1. To analyze FitBit Fitness Tracker Data from thirty eligible FitBit users, in order to gain some
     insights to help with marketing Bellabeat product.
     
  2. To focus on one of Bellabeatâ€™s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how
     customers are using their smart devices.

For this case study, I will focus on Bellabeat smart watch. 


2: Prepare

2.1 Data Source
  1. The data is a free data from fitbit user made available through Mobius. It contains
     personal fitness tracker data from over thirty fitbit users who have given consent to
     use their data.
  2. There are 18 csv files but I have used only 2 files for now to just focus on daily activities,
     calories burned and to find the sleeping schedule and patterns.

2.2 Sorting the data
  1. I used jupyter notebook to open the dataset and used panda framework to work with        the data. For this project I downloaded the CSV files in my laptop and loaded            them in Jupyter notebook.


2.3 Data Credibility
   1. As a general rule of thumb for a large enough sample condition, we need at-least 30
      or greater sample size. Since we have 33 users we can get good insights in general.

   2. In terms of recency, the data is within 10 years range so it's still reliable.
   3. Additionally, the data collected also matches Bellabeat's product, hence the result
      from this data can be applied to Bellabeat's products.

3. Process

   3.1 Loading Libraries:
   First, I loaded the libraries (Pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and datetime) for      processing and visualizing the data.

   Then I loaded the datasets daily_activity.csv and sleepDaily.csv.

   3.2 Data Exploration:
